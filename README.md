# Knapsack_Brute_Force
Implement brute force method to solve knapsack problem. 

Generate characteristic vectors  that represent all combinations of items in knapsack.
Characteristic vectors must be generated from binary representation of consecutive numbers from 0 to 2^n-1.
You can't save solutions in memory (polynomial space complexity), You can't use recursion. You can't use ready functions to generate binary representation.

Check feasibility and  find the optimal solution: the maximum value of items in knapsack.
First line in a file is the maximum capacity of a knapsack, each next line represents item and contains  the value and weight of an item.

Print the best solution: characteristic vector, total value and total weight of items in a knapsack.
Optional: print execution time of your algorithm.
